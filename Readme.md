compute the luxury watch brand index based on the annual transaction values by watch value. In this case, we'll consider the individual watch values for each brand.

Use Case: Computing a Luxury Watch Brand Index by Watch Value

Objective:
To create a luxury watch brand index that reflects the annual transaction performance of top luxury watch brands in the secondary watch market based on the individual values of the watches.

Methodology:

Selection of Brands: Identify the top 5 luxury watch brands based on the sum of the values of their individual watches in the secondary market.
Weight Assignment: Assign weights to each brand based on the sum of the values of their individual watches relative to the total sum of values for the selected brands. Brands with higher total watch values get higher weights.
Index Calculation: Compute the index value using a weighted average of the sum of values of the individual watches for the selected brands. The formula remains similar:
Index Value

∑

(

�
×
Weight
�
)
Index Value=∑ 
i=1

​
 (Sum of Values

​
 ×Weight

​
 )

Rebalancing: Rebalance the index annually, adjusting the weights based on the updated sum of values for the watches of each brand in the previous year.
Example:
Consider five luxury watch brands - Brand A, Brand B, Brand C, Brand D, and Brand E.

Sum of Values of Brand A's watches: $100 million
Sum of Values of Brand B's watches: $80 million
Sum of Values of Brand C's watches: $50 million
Sum of Values of Brand D's watches: $90 million
Sum of Values of Brand E's watches: $120 million
Total Sum of Values = $100M + $80M + $50M + $90M + $120M = $440 million

Weights:

Weight of Brand A: 
100
440
440
100
​
  or approximately 22.73%
Weight of Brand B: 
80
440
440

​
  or approximately 18.18%
Weight of Brand C: 
50

440

​
  or approximately 11.36%
Weight of Brand D: 
90
440
440

​
  or approximately 20.45%
Weight of Brand E: 
120

440

​
  or approximately 27.27%
If we use these weights to calculate the index value based on the sum of values of the individual watches, we get:

Index Value
=
(
100
×
0.2273
)
+
(
80
×
0.1818
)
+
(
50
×
0.1136
)
+
(
90
×
0.2045
)
+
(
120
×
0.2727
)
Index Value=(100×0.2273)+(80×0.1818)+(50×0.1136)+(90×0.2045)+(120×0.2727)

This index value would represent the overall annual transaction performance of these luxury watch brands in the secondary market, with the weights reflecting the relative contribution of each brand's individual watches. Rebalancing would be done annually based on the updated sum of values for the watches of each brand.
